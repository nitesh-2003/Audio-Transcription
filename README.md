# Text-Transcription
This Project sets up a simple audio-to-text converter using the browser's microphone, a Flask backend to process audio, and the Google Speech Recognition API to transcribe it into text. Users can record audio, transcribe it, save the transcription, or upload an audio file for transcription.
